# Autophagy project
---
This project is a gene list project based on the circadian work pattern. The `ye_circadian_code` directory contains `Ye`'s code related to TCGA analysis.

The autophagy-lysosome genes are not fully studied in PanCan. I will use `ye` former code to build a more intuitive pipeline to analyze a set of gene using TCGA level 3 data.

The data and pipeline should be segregated. Because the data was process by others. And can be scalable to add more data or more analysis.

## Data
Here is the data position and data description.
### Location


## Pipeline
### Difference between tumor and normal
#### Mutation
#### Expression
#### CNV
#### Methylation
#### Clinical

### Regulation between data
#### On Expression
##### Mutation affects expression
##### CNV affects expreession
##### Methylation affects expression

#### On Clinical
##### Mutation Difference affects clinical
##### CNV
##### Methylation
