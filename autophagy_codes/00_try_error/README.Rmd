# Autophagy flux TAE.

## Use TCGA RPPA data.

- Use p62 RPPA data to categorize patient sample.
- Use BECN1 to categorize patient samples.
- Use the ration of p62 / becn1, as p62 increase and becn1 decrease represent the low autophagy flux.
- Intersect the result of three method, whether they have a high overlaps.


## Use mRNA expression data 

1. The Guideline paper (Klionsky, Autophagy, 2016) list some of marker genes. Use this marker genes as the score index.
2. Try use upstream genes TOR/MTOR, AMPK phosphoralation data.
